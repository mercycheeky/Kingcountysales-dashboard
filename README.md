# Project Title : King County Washington House Sales Dashboard 🏚️
## Introduction
The project involves creating a dynamic interactive dashboard that uses a calendar widget to filter values on the other tableau elements that have been inserted on the dashboard: 
 - The distribution of house prices histogram
 - Distribution of bedrooms histogram
 - View vs condition of the house, heat map
 - Distribution of bathrooms histogram
Also uses a 'select year built' widget ,'select sqft living' widget and a 'select sqft lot' widget to filter values on the above mentioned elements.
On the dashboard is also a line chart that shows the average house sale price in different months. A map too, that displays the different houses on the grid. A hover will simply display the zipcode of the house and it's average sale price.
